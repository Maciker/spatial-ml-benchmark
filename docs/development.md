# Local development

Use Node.js 22 or 24, Corepack and pinned pnpm 10.17.1. From the repository root:

```sh
corepack enable
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm quality:fast
pnpm build
pnpm quality:full
pnpm quality:stabilization
```

For environments with a different global pnpm, use `corepack pnpm` or enable Corepack shims first. Esbuild is the sole allowlisted dependency build script.

Run `pnpm demo` for the tiny numerical-kernel demonstration. It does not download data, run a raster pipeline, train a model or evaluate spatial folds. Those capabilities have explicit backlog tickets. Configuration examples describe the planned pipeline and are not yet consumed by the demo.
